# Swiggy-FunnelAnalysis
The goal of this project is to analyze a Swiggy dataset and conduct an in-depth analysis to understand the reasons behind the rise and fall in orders using funnel analysis. We need to understand the root causes that go up and down, starting with different conversions. Also to make possible suggestions for improvement in a growing company.
